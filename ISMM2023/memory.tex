WE have multiple improvement on the memory consumption. 
1. We will avoid the use of huge pages for metadata, which significantly reduce the memory consumption for small-footprint applications. 

2. We will allocate the memory from the same huge page, even if they are different size classes. 

3. We will try to minimize the pages for medium-size objects, by introducing the bitmaps.
