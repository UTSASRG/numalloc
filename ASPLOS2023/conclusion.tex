\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\NM{} is a memory allocator that is specially designed for the NUMA architecture. Applications can be linked to \NM{} directly, without the change of code and the recompilation. \NM{} is different from existing memory allocators, as it is the first binding-based allocator. 
On top of it, it further proposes origin-aware memory management and incremental sharing to improve the locality and exploit huge pages. 
% It further proposes threads-shared incremental allocation and origin-aware memory management to improve the locality. 
Based on our extensive evaluation, \NM{} achieves a significantly better performance than other popular allocators on the NUMA architecture, which is running \NEW{15.7\%} faster (and up to $6.8\times$ faster) than the second-best allocator.
