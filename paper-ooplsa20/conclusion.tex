\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\NM{} is a drop-in memory allocator replacement that is specially designed for the NUMA architecture. Applications can be linked to \NM{} directly, without the change of code and the recompilation. \NM{} is different from existing memory allocators, since it proposes  fine-grained memory management to accommodate the heterogeneity of both modern hardware and applications. It further proposes binding-based memory management and an interleaved heap to ensure locality and load balance. 
Based on our extensive evaluation, \NM{} achieves a significantly better performance than other popular allocators on the NUMA architecture, up to $5.8\times$ faster than the default allocator.  \NM{} is available at https://github.com/availableuponacceptance.
