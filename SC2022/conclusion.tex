\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\NM{} is a memory allocator that is specially designed for the NUMA architecture. Applications can be linked to \NM{} directly, without the change of code and the recompilation. \NM{} is different from existing memory allocators, as it is the first binding-based allocator. It further proposes threads-shared incremental allocation and origin-aware memory management to improve the locality. 
Based on our extensive evaluation, \NM{} achieves a significantly better performance than other popular allocators on the NUMA architecture, which is running 15\% faster (and up to $2.9\times$ faster) than the second-best allocator.
