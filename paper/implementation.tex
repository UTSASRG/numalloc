\subsection{Node-Local Allocation}

What is the basic idea of allocation? 
Basically, upon receiving a request, \NM{} will check the size of the object at first. If the size is less than the threshold of big objects, this is a small object. 

For small objects, \NM{} will always allocate them from the PerThreadHeap. Since a PerThreadHeap will be only utilized by one thread, it won't need the synchronization, and possibly has the better scalability.
