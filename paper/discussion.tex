\section{Limitation}
\label{sec:limit}

Possible limitations. Sometimes, \NM{} utilizes more memory than the default allocator. 

Second, currently, \NM{} may introduce some reliability issue by preallocating a huge chunk of memory from the OS in the beginning. A program that will be crashed in other allocators may not crash if the address is landed on the pre-allocated range. Instead, \NM{} aims to achieve the high performance only.
