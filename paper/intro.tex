How to design the new allocator?

We will try to achieve the following target. 

(1) The performance will be as efficient as possible. 
(2) It is still 


For information-computable, we will achieve the following targets:
We should still use the address to infer the following information, such as the size of the object and the shadow memory placement.

We don't support many bags for the same size class, just one big bag for each size class of each heap. Why it is necessary? 

We would like to reduce the memory blowup as much as possible, where the memory will be returned back to the current thread's heap. 

In order to support that, maybe we could have a big heap for the same size class, but different threads will start from different placement. 

Is it good for the NUMA support in the future? For NUMA support, it is great if we can always return the memory back to its original
