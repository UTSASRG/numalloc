\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Performance Evaluation}

\subsubsection{NUMA Architecture}
We will compare with popular allocator, such as glibc, or tcmalloc, or NUMA-aware tcmalloc , jemalloc, scalloc. 

%Scalloc is located in https://github.com/cksystemsgroup/scalloc

% Christoph also has a benchmark suite to evaluate the performance of memory allocator. 


\subsubsection{UMA Architecture}
We will compare the performance even on non-numa architecture, which could be more general.
