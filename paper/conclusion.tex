\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\NM{} is a drop-in memory allocator replacement that is specially designed for the NUMA architecture. Applications can be linked to \NM{} directly, without the change and the recompilation. \NM{} can  automatically adapt to the hardware with different number of NUMA nodes and hardware cores. It employs multiple mechanisms, such as the combination of task assignment and memory management, node-aware memory management, interleaved heap, and explicit huge page support together to improve the performance. Based on extensive evaluation, \NM{} achieves significantly better performance than all existing allocators on the NUMA architecture.
