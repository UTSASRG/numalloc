The NUMA architecture was proposed to accommodate the hardware trend of the increasing number of CPU cores. However, most existing memory allocators were not designed for the NUMA architecture, leading to a bad performance for the NUMA architecture, while NUMA-aware allocators still miss multiple performance opportunities. This paper proposes a novel memory allocator--\NM{}---that is designed for the NUMA architecture. \NM{} proposes a binding-based memory management and an interleaved heap to ensure locality and load balance. \NM{} also proposes fine-grained memory management that is based on the size, the allocation pattern, the shared pattern, the origin of objects, and the location of a thread. According to our extensive evaluation, \NM{} has the best performance among all evaluated allocators. It is significantly faster than the second best one, around 11\% on average on an 8-node machine. For the best case, \NM{} achieves up to $5.8\times$ performance speedup comparing to the default Linux allocator, and $4.7\times$ faster than the second best one (TcMalloc). \NM{} is also scalable to 128 threads, and is ready for the deployment.
