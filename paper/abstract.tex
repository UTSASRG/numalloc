The NUMA architecture was proposed to accommodate the hardware trend with the increasing number of CPU cores. However, existing memory allocators have multiple issues for support the NUMA architecture: most of them were not designed for the NUMA architecture; NUMA-aware allocators still miss some performance opportunities. 

This paper proposes a novel memory allocator--\NM{}---that is designed for the NUMA architecture and can adapt to a specific machine automatically. Different from existing allocators, \NM{} integrates the task assignment into the allocator, where each thread is bound to a NUMA node in an interleaved way. Based on the location of a task, \NM{} designs a node-aware memory allocation. \NM{} also utilizes huge page support to improve the performance, and designs an interleaved heap to accommodate shared objects. Based on its extensive evaluation, \NM{} has the best performance among all evaluated allocators. It is significantly faster than the second best one, around 11\% on average on an 8-node machine. For the best case, \NM{} achieves up to $5.8\times$ performance speedup comparing to the default Linux allocator, and $4.7\times$ faster than the second best one (TcMalloc). \NM{} is also scalable to 128 threads, and is ready for the deployment.
