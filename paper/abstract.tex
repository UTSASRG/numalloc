The NUMA architecture was proposed to accommodate the hardware trend with the increasing number of CPU cores. However, existing memory allocators have multiple issues for support the NUMA architecture: most of them were not designed for the NUMA architecture; NUMA-aware allocators still miss some performance opportunities promised by the hardware. 

This paper proposes a novel memory allocator--\NM{}---that is designed for the NUMA architecture. Different from existing allocators, \NM{} integrates the task assignment into the allocator, where each thread is bound to a specific core in an interleaved way. Based on the location of a task, \NM{} designs a node-aware memory allocation. \NM{} also utilizes huge page support to improve the performance, and designs its interleaved and block-wise memory allocation to accommodate shared objects. 
%\NM{} supports huge pages that are already available inside the OS and the hardware, and introduces an optional interleaved heap. 
Based on its extensive evaluation, \NM{} achieves up to $5\times$ performance speedup comparing to the default Linu	x allocator.
