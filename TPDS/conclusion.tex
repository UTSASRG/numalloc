\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\NM{} is a memory allocator that is specially designed for the NUMA architecture. Applications can be linked to \NM{} directly, without the change of code and the recompilation. \NM{} is different from existing memory allocators, since it proposes fine-grained memory management to accommodate the heterogeneity of both modern hardware and applications. It further proposes origin-based allocations to improve the locality, node-balanced thread binding and an interleaved heap to reduce the load imbalance, and explicit huge pages to employ the benefits of huge pages. 
Based on our extensive evaluation, \NM{} achieves a significantly better performance than other popular allocators on the NUMA architecture, with 15\% performance speedup on average and up to $6.4\times$ faster.
