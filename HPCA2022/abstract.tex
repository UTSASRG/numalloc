The NUMA architecture accommodates the hardware trend of the increasing number of CPU cores. It also introduces hardware heterogeneity that requires the cooperation of memory allocators to achieve the good performance for multithreaded applications. Unfortunately, none of existing memory allocators support the NUMA architecture very well. 
This paper presents a novel memory allocator--\NM{}, with fine-grained memory management that is designed for the NUMA architecture. \NM{} first proposes an origin-based memory management to ensure the locality of memory allocations. It further introduces node-balanced thread binding and an interleaved heap to reduce the load imbalance among different nodes. 
According to our extensive evaluation, \NM{} has the best performance among all evaluated allocators. It is significantly faster than the second best one, around 15.8\% on average on an 8-node machine, and is 18.5\% faster than the default Linux allocator. For the best case, \NM{} achieves up to $6.4\times$ performance speedup comparing to the default Linux allocator, and $4.6\times$ faster than the second-best one (TCMalloc). \NM{} is also scalable to 128 threads, and is ready for the deployment.
